> Problem: It's always the question "What are we eating tonight?" and once the decision is made to put together a shopping list with the ingredients needed to take to the supermarket
> 
> Solution: A cooking app that let's the user choose favourite recipes, generates a random recipe so they don't have to search, then they can add the ingredients to a shopping list with just the click of a button and the ingredients will be sorted by category for the user
